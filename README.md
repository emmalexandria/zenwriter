# Zenwriter&#x20;

**A zen Markdown writing experience**



Zenwriter is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app) based Markdown editor which was thrown together in a couple of days. The editor itself relies heavily on [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/). As of right now, there are only builds available for 64 bit Windows, but I have the ability to build for MacOS and Linux and will do so soon.



### Aims

*   Fast to start, low memory usage
*   Minimally distracting UI
*   Simple but aesthetically pleasing rendering

### Roadmap

*   Get accurate wordcount functionality
*   Move most of the backend logic to Rust to tidy up the frontend code
*   Integration with system dark-mode
*   Responsive text sizing according to window size
*   System spellcheck disable
*   Styled scrollbar



### Warning

As I stated, I threw this together in a couple days. It's gonna be rough around the edges, probably for a little bit.&#x20;

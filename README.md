# ZenWriter
**A simple markdown editor that gets out of your way**

It's a text editor for those that want the ability to write formatted Markdown documents with absolutely no distraction.

It consumes < 200mb of memory, nearly no CPU, and starts up near instantly. Builds are available for MacOS, Windows, and Linux in the release section.

Built in [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev) using [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev) for the editor.

## Installation

Binaries for MacOS, Windows, and Linux are available in the releases section.

ZenWriter has no need for an installation directory, but there are installers available in `.dmg`, `.exe`, and `.msi`. 

### Building from source
To build from source, you'll require Rust and NodeJS. To build this app, clone the repository and then run `npm run tauri build`. The binaries can be found in /tauri-src/target/release.

## Roadmap
This repository went public at what I consider to be the V1.0 release. There are still outstanding issues, but for now I'm going to take some time away from this project. I'll do by best to be a good repo owner and merge good contributions, but for a couple months I won't be around to direct major changes.
